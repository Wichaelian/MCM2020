# MCM2020
Hello, welcome to our submission for Cornell's Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2020!
We are Katherine Faiola, Jonathan Pomerantz and Michael Wang.

This year we were tasked with finding the optimal schedule for Mobile Food Pantry trucks to deliver food to residents in New York State.

Please feel free to explore the model in the juypyter notebook - especially the interactive maps, graphs and pareto frontiers.

Thanks for checking out the code that shaped our project!
